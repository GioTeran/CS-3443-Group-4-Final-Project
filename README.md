Our parking assistance app strives to be able to apply an intuitive user interface 
that depends on human input about parking in real/periods of time and employ an 
algorithm to display parking options and calculate the most affordable option. Parking 
can be very rule intensive at our campus and varies significantly, so employing a 
software to ease that would increase efficiency dramatically.
